# My Luhn Algorithm Implementation in Python

The Luhn Algorithm is a method I've implemented in Python, which is widely used for error-checking, especially in validating credit card numbers and other identification numbers.

## Overview

You'll find my Python implementation of the Luhn Algorithm in this repository. It checks the validity of a given numerical input by performing specific calculations based on the digits in the input.

## Features

- **Validation**: My implementation allows you to determine whether a numerical input passes the Luhn Algorithm validation.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily integrate my implementation into various Python projects.
- **Efficiency**: I've implemented the algorithm concisely and efficiently.

## Usage

To use my Luhn Algorithm implementation in your Python projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/walkrrr/luhn-algorithm
    ```

2. Import the `luhn_algorithm` module into your Python script:

    ```python
    from luhn_algorithm import luhn_check
    ```

3. Use the `luhn_check` function to validate a numerical input:

    ```python
    number = "1234567890123456"
    if luhn_check(number):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")
    ```
